# Radlands Online

A browser-based implementation of the Radlands card game.

## Overview
This project is a digital adaptation of Radlands, a two-player dueling card game set in a post-apocalyptic world. Players aim to destroy their opponent's three camps while protecting their own using people cards, events, and special abilities.

## Game Description
Radlands is a competitive, dueling card game where players lead post-apocalyptic survivors in a battle to protect their three camps from rival tribes. The main resource is water, used to play people and events, and activate card abilities. The game features strategic depth with multiple card synergies and interaction possibilities.
