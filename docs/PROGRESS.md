# Radlands Online - Project Progress

## Current Status
We have established the initial project structure and defined the core architecture for our Radlands online implementation.

## Completed Work

### Project Setup
- Created GitHub repository
- Established basic folder structure
- Added game rules documentation

### Data Models
- Defined card data structures (BaseCard, CampCard, PersonCard, EventCard)
- Created model for abilities and effects
- Designed trait system
- Implemented Player and Game State models
- Added Column concept for tracking card positioning

### UI Planning
- Outlined component hierarchy
- Defined player interaction patterns
- Planned visual feedback systems
- Created card detail view specifications

### Game Flow Design
- Defined complete game setup sequence
- Outlined turn structure and phases
- Implemented special first-turn rule
- Added random starting player selection

### App Flow Design

### Player Control System
- Designed interaction state management system
- Created control flow for off-turn player interactions
- Implemented targeting and response mechanisms
- Defined interaction types for different game scenarios

- Designed complete application user journey
- Defined menu structure and navigation
- Outlined game setup and end-game sequences
- Created application state transition model

## Architecture Decisions

### State Management
- Using TypeScript interfaces to define game state
- Modeling card states (damaged, destroyed, ready) as properties on card objects
- Tracking card positions via column-based structure
- Managing Water Silo location via player state

### Effect System
- Composite pattern for complex effects
- Conditional effects to handle "if-then" scenarios
- Ability reference system to solve "ability-within-ability" challenge

### UI Approach

### Interactive Control System
- Tracking player interaction state separately from game state
- Managing control flow between players for special interactions
- Dynamic targeting system for abilities and effects
- Structured approach to temporary control transfers

- Modal-based card interaction system
- Two-step process for card placement and targeting
- Visual indicators for card states
- Event queue visualization

## Card Interaction Methods

### Card Modal Interface
- Clicking on any card opens a centered modal with large card view
- Modal includes context-appropriate action buttons based on card type and location
- For hand cards, horizontal scrolling allows viewing all cards in hand

### Two-Step Card Placement
- When player selects "Play" on a person card in the modal
- Modal minimizes but remains partially visible
- Game board highlights valid placement locations
- Player clicks on a valid column slot to complete the placement
- Similar approach for abilities that require targeting

## Game Flow

### Game Setup
- Create game and initialize decks
- Players join and are assigned positions
- Deal 6 camp cards to each player
- Players select 3 camps each
- Calculate starting hand size based on camps
- Deal appropriate cards to each player
- Set up Water Silo and Raiders cards
- Randomly determine first player (digital equivalent of flipping a water token)
- Begin first turn with special water token rule (first player gets 1 water)

### Turn Sequence
1. **Events Phase**
   - Resolve events in position 1
   - Move all other events forward
   
2. **Replenish Phase**
   - Draw a card
   - Replenish water tokens (1 for first player on first turn, 3 otherwise)
   
3. **Actions Phase**
   - Players can take any number of actions while they have resources
   - Actions include playing cards, using abilities, and junking cards
   
4. **End Turn**
   - Pass turn to opponent
   - If both players have taken a turn, advance turn counter

## Application Flow

### App Launch & Main Menu
- Splash Screen
  - Animated logo
  - Transition to main menu
- Main Menu
  - New Game option
  - Join Game option (via code)
  - Rules/Tutorial button
  - Settings (volume, animation speed)
  - Exit button
- New Game Flow
  - Game code generation
  - Waiting screen with shareable link
  - Opponent join notification

### Game Setup Sequence
- Connection confirmation screen
- Camp selection interface
  - Each player selects 3 camps from their 6 options
  - When both players have selected, camps are revealed to both players
- First player determination animation (water token flip)
- Transition to game board
  - Initial hand dealt based on camp values
  - First player starts with 1 water token

### Game End Flow
- Victory/Defeat Screen
  - Dynamic announcement
  - Victory animation
  - Game statistics display
- Post-Game Options
  - Play Again button
  - Return to Main Menu button
  - Exit Game button

### State Transitions
enum ApplicationState {
  SPLASH_SCREEN,
  MAIN_MENU,
  WAITING_FOR_OPPONENT,
  CAMP_SELECTION,
  GAME_IN_PROGRESS,
  GAME_OVER
}

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. Create card analysis document to identify state tracking needs for each card
2. Define the game flow and turn phases in greater detail
3. Create wireframes for the main game interface
4. Plan network protocol for multiplayer communication

### Technical Implementation
1. Set up project with React frontend
2. Establish Node.js backend
3. Implement core game engine
4. Build basic UI components

## Open Questions
- How to handle edge cases in card ability interactions
- Best approach for implementing networking (WebSockets vs other options)
- Testing strategy for complex game logic
