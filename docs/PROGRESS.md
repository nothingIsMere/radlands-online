### App Flow Design
- Designed complete application user journey
- Defined menu structure and navigation
- Outlined game setup and end-game sequences
- Created application state transition model

## Architecture Decisions

### State Management
- Using TypeScript interfaces to define game state
- Modeling card states (damaged, destroyed, ready) as properties on card objects
- Tracking card positions via column-based structure
- Managing Water Silo location via player state

### Effect System
- Composite pattern for complex effects
- Conditional effects to handle "if-then" scenarios
- Ability reference system to solve "ability-within-ability" challenge

### UI Approach
- Modal-based card interaction system
- Two-step process for card placement and targeting
- Visual indicators for card states
- Event queue visualization
- Fixed player positioning (left/right) regardless of active player
- Visual indication of active player using highlighting and borders

### Interactive Control System
- Tracking player interaction state separately from game state
- Managing control flow between players for special interactions
- Dynamic targeting system for abilities and effects
- Structured approach to temporary control transfers

## Current Implementation Details

### Game Board Layout
- Players positioned on opposite sides (left/right)
- Each player area contains:
  - 3 camp slots along the bottom
  - 2 person slots above each camp (creating columns)
  - Event queue with 3 positions
  - Hand area for current player with horizontal scrolling
- Central area contains:
  - Draw and discard piles
  - Turn and phase indicators
  - Water Silo and Raiders card slots
  - Game controls (End Turn button)

### Visual Design
- Clear distinction between slots and cards
- Visual indication of card states (damaged, destroyed, not ready)
- Active player highlighting
- Proper scaling to fit screen dimensions
- Single-row hand cards with horizontal scrolling if needed

### Game State Management
- Turn-based gameplay with player switching
- Phase transitions with appropriate visual feedback
- Water token management
- Protection mechanics visualization

## Card Interaction Methods

### Card Modal Interface
- Clicking on any card opens a centered modal with large card view
- Modal includes context-appropriate action buttons based on card type and location
- For hand cards, horizontal scrolling allows viewing all cards in hand

### Two-Step Card Placement
- When player selects "Play" on a person card in the modal
- Modal minimizes but remains partially visible
- Game board highlights valid placement locations
- Player clicks on a valid column slot to complete the placement
- Similar approach for abilities that require targeting

## Game Flow

### Game Setup
- Create game and initialize decks
- Players join and are assigned positions
- Deal 6 camp cards to each player
- Players select 3 camps each
- Calculate starting hand size based on camps
- Deal appropriate cards to each player
- Set up Water Silo and Raiders cards
- Randomly determine first player (digital equivalent of flipping a water token)
- Begin first turn with special water token rule (first player gets 1 water)

### Turn Sequence
1. **Events Phase**
   - Resolve events in position 1
   - Move all other events forward
   
2. **Replenish Phase**
   - Draw a card
   - Replenish water tokens (1 for first player on first turn, 3 otherwise)
   
3. **Actions Phase**
   - Players can take any number of actions while they have resources
   - Actions include playing cards, using abilities, and junking cards
   
4. **End Turn**
   - Pass turn to opponent
   - If both players have taken a turn, advance turn counter

## Application Flow

### App Launch & Main Menu
- Splash Screen
  - Animated logo
  - Transition to main menu
- Main Menu
  - New Game option
  - Join Game option (via code)
  - Rules/Tutorial button
  - Settings (volume, animation speed)
  - Exit button
- New Game Flow
  - Game code generation
  - Waiting screen with shareable link
  - Opponent join notification

### Game Setup Sequence
- Connection confirmation screen
- Camp selection interface
  - Each player selects 3 camps from their 6 options
  - When both players have selected, camps are revealed to both players
- First player determination animation (water token flip)
- Transition to game board
  - Initial hand dealt based on camp values
  - First player starts with 1 water token

### Game End Flow
- Victory/Defeat Screen
  - Dynamic announcement
  - Victory animation
  - Game statistics display
- Post-Game Options
  - Play Again button
  - Return to Main Menu button
  - Exit Game button

### State Transitions
```typescript
enum ApplicationState {
  SPLASH_SCREEN,
  MAIN_MENU,
  WAITING_FOR_OPPONENT,
  CAMP_SELECTION,
  GAME_IN_PROGRESS,
  GAME_OVER
}
```

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. Implement core game mechanics:
   - Card playing functionality
   - Ability activation system
   - Targeting mechanism for abilities
   - Effect resolution logic

2. Add interaction handlers:
   - Card selection and placement
   - Ability targeting
   - Water token spending

3. Create full card database:
   - Implement all camp cards
   - Implement all person cards
   - Implement all event cards

### Technical Implementation
1. Enhance game state management:
   - Add proper reducers for game actions
   - Implement game rules validation
   - Create effect execution system

2. Build networking foundation:
   - Establish client-server communication
   - Implement game state synchronization
   - Add player authentication
   - Plan network protocol for multiplayer communication (WebSockets vs other options)

3. Enhance user experience:
   - Add animations for card actions
   - Improve visual design and theming
   - Create tutorial/onboarding flow

## Implementation Approach
Following the analysis in CARD_ANALYSIS.md, we plan to implement cards in this order:

1. Core mechanic cards (basic Damage, Draw, etc.)
2. Simple camp cards with straightforward abilities
3. Simple person cards with direct effects
4. Simple events with immediate effects
5. More complex camps with state tracking
6. Complex people with conditional abilities
7. Complex events with game-altering effects

This ensures we can build a working game with basic functionality first, then layer in more complex card interactions.
