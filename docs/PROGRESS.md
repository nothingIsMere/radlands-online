# Radlands Online - Project Progress

## Current Status
We have established the initial project structure and defined the core architecture for our Radlands online implementation.

## Completed Work

### Project Setup
- Created GitHub repository
- Established basic folder structure
- Added game rules documentation

### Data Models
- Defined card data structures (BaseCard, CampCard, PersonCard, EventCard)
- Created model for abilities and effects
- Designed trait system
- Implemented Player and Game State models
- Added Column concept for tracking card positioning

### UI Planning
- Outlined component hierarchy
- Defined player interaction patterns
- Planned visual feedback systems
- Created card detail view specifications

## Architecture Decisions

### State Management
- Using TypeScript interfaces to define game state
- Modeling card states (damaged, destroyed, ready) as properties on card objects
- Tracking card positions via column-based structure
- Managing Water Silo location via player state

### Effect System
- Composite pattern for complex effects
- Conditional effects to handle "if-then" scenarios
- Ability reference system to solve "ability-within-ability" challenge

### UI Approach
- Hover previews for quick card inspection
- Context menus for card interactions
- Visual indicators for card states
- Event queue visualization

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. Create card analysis document to identify state tracking needs for each card
2. Define the game flow and turn phases in greater detail
3. Create wireframes for the main game interface
4. Plan network protocol for multiplayer communication

### Technical Implementation
1. Set up project with React frontend
2. Establish Node.js backend
3. Implement core game engine
4. Build basic UI components

## Open Questions
- How to handle edge cases in card ability interactions
- Best approach for implementing networking (WebSockets vs other options)
- Testing strategy for complex game logic
