OVERVIEW

In Radlands, players will receive a set of three unique camps to protect.
You win by destroying all three of your opponent’s camps.
The main resource in the game is water. You will spend it to play people and events,
and to use the abilities of cards you already have on the table. People protect your
camps and provide useful abilities, while events are powerful effects that take time
to pay off.
Both players draw cards from the same deck. All cards in your hand can either be
played to the table or discarded for quick “junk” effects. To win, you will need to
manage your cards and water wisely.

GAME TURNS
There are three phases on your turn:
1. Events - Advance and resolve your events.
2. Replenish - Draw a card and collect your 3 water discs for use this turn.
3. Actions - Put cards into play, discard cards from your hand for an instant junk
effect, and / or use abilities on ”ready” cards. After finishing your actions, return
all water and extra water discs to their respective supplies.

GENERAL SET-UP

Players sit on opposite sides of the table facing each other. In the center of the table,
accessible to both players:

1. Shuffle and place the camp deck.
2. Place the extra water discs (black).
3. Shuffle and place the draw deck, leaving space for a discard pile beside it.


PLAY AREA SETUP

Each player sets up their own play area with the following steps:
1. Draw 6 cards from the camp deck.
2. Place 3 of your drawn camps facedown in your play area in a row.
Leave space for 2 cards in front of each camp, where you will be playing
people cards later. When both players have selected, flip your camps faceup.
Return all unselected camps and the camp deck to the box as they will no
longer be used this game.
3. Take a Water Silo and Raiders card and place them
faceup in your play area.
4. Form a supply of 3 water discs (white) in
your play area.
5. Take a player aid card.
6. Draw the number of cards to your hand equal to
the total sum of cards shown in the black rectangles
on your camps

CARD TYPES

CAMPS
Camp cards have a black border.
They have an initial card draw
amount , and may have one or
more abilities and [ traits ] .

PERSON
A person (people) card has a white
border. They are played in columns in
front of your camp cards.
People have a water cost C , a junk
effect, and may have one or more
abilities and [ traits ]

[ CARD TRAITS ]
Card traits are found on some
camps and people, surrounded by
[ green brackets ] on a white
background.
They are active for all people who
are not currently damaged. They
are always active on camps not yet
destroyed (even if they are damaged)


PUNKS
A punk is a person with no abilities,
represented by a facedown card drawn
from the top of the deck.
When damaged, a punk is immediately
destroyed, and returned to the top of
the deck facedown (do not look at it).

EVENTS
Event cards have a yellow and black
striped border.
Events have a water cost, a junk
effect, an event effect , and a
numbered bomb icon that
determines where it is placed in your
event queue when played.

PLAY AREA

EVENT QUEUE: Each player has an
event queue made up of 3 spaces. The 3
space is in line with your camps, with the
2 and 1 spaces in front. The event queue is a
countdown timer, where each space represents
the number of turns until an event is resolved

COLUMNS: People cards (including
Punks ) are played to the table in front of your
camp cards. A camp and all people in front of it
are considered a “column” . A column may
contain a maximum of 2 people.

UNPROTECTED: When your people
or camps do not have at least one of your cards
in front of them, they are unprotected

WATER DISCARD: Some actions
may require you to spend water that is not
placed onto a card. To keep it clear to both
players that this water has been spent, stack it
beside the draw deck. Also do this when
discarding a card with water on it.

EFFECTS

DESTROY
Destroy the specified card(s).
• When a person is destroyed,
discard it.
• Destroyed camps are flipped to
their destroyed side.
• A destroyed punk is returned
facedown on top of the draw deck
(don’t look at it).

DAMAGE
Damage a person or camp.
• A damaged card is turned sideways.
• If it is damaged again, destroy it.
• A damaged person is not ready.
• A damaged punk is destroyed.
Important: Unless otherwise
specified, the target of damage
must be an unprotected card in
any column that belongs to your
opponent.

INJURE
Same as damage, but only applies
to people.

RESTORE
You may rotate one of your damaged
cards upright. If it is a person, mark it
as not ready . New in v1.2: A card
cannot restore itself

DRAW
Draw a card from the draw deck.

GAIN PUNK
You may place the top card of the
draw deck into play, facedown in any
of your columns. It is a person with
no abilities.

EXTRA WATER
Gain 1 extra water (black)
disc to spend this turn.
At the end of your turn,
return all extra water discs
to the supply in the center of the table.
Extra water discs are not limited by the
supply (borrow white water discs
from your opponent if necessary).

RAID
When resolving the raid
icon, play or advance
your Raiders event card.
• If your Raiders event is not
already in the event queue,
place it on the 2 space 
• If your Raiders event is already in the event
queue, advance it 1 space forward. If it is
already on the 1 space, resolve the event.
The Raiders event cannot be advanced with
a raid icon if another event already
occupies the space in front of it.
When the Raiders event resolves, your
opponent chooses one of their camps to be
damaged, then put your Raiders card back in
your play area.

TURN SEQUENCE

Beginning with the start player, take turns until one
player has destroyed all of their opponent’s camps. On
your turn, perform all of the following phases in the
order listed:

1. EVENTS
If you have an event in the 1 space, resolve its effect
and discard it. Then, advance all events in your queue 1
space forward (towards your opponent)

2. REPLENISH
Draw a card . Then, collect your 3 water discs for
use this turn. Water is never carried over from previous
turns, so you will always begin the Actions phase with
3 water.
Exception: if you are the start player, collect 1 water
(instead of 3) on your first turn. On all subsequent turns,
including your opponent’s first turn, players collect 3.

3. ACTIONS
Perform any of the following actions, in any order, any
number of times:
• Play card
• Draw card
• Junk card
• Take Water Silo
• Use ability
Zero-cost cards & abilities: Some cards and abilities have
a cost of 0 water. Whenever you use a 0-cost ability, or play
a 0-cost card, mark it as not ready with an extra water disc
showing the pink dash .
Actions cleanup: When you are done performing actions,
return all water and extra water discs to their
respective supplies

ACTIONS 

PLAY CARD (PERSON)
Play a person card from your hand in front of
any one of your camps (even a destroyed camp).
When playing a person:
• Spend water discs onto the card equal to
its cost shown in the top left.
• The turn a person is played, it is not ready.
• If there is already a person in that column,
place the new person in frontor
behind the existing person (moving
the existing person forward). When a
person behind another is destroyed, move
the person in front back toward the camp.
• Each column can contain a maximum of 2
people. New in v1.2: If you have no space in any
of your columns, you may play a person but you
must first destroy one of your existing people.

PLAY CARD (EVENT)

Play an event card from your hand
to your event queue.
When playing an event:
• Place the event in the space
corresponding to the numbered
bomb icon at the top of its
yellow effect box.
• Spend water discs onto the
card equal to its cost shown in
the top left.
• A 0 event is not placed in the
queue. Instead, resolve its effect
immediately and discard it and
the water required to play it.
• Only one card can occupy each
space of your event queue. If that
space is already occupied by
another event, you must put the
new event in the first available
space behind (up to space
3). If those spaces are full, you may not play it

DRAW CARD
Spend 2 water and
draw a card.

JUNK CARD
Discard a card from your hand and
receive the junk effect related to
the icon 
pictured in the top left corner of
the card.
Note: When you junk the Water
Silo, return it to your play area
instead of discarding it.

TAKE WATER SILO
Spend 1 water to
take your Water Silo
into your hand. The
Water Silo may be
junked to gain an extra
water .
• When you junk the Water Silo,
return it to your play area instead
of discarding it.
• You may keep the Water Silo in
your hand across multiple turns.

USE ABILITY
Use an ability on one of your ready
camps or people in any column.
Abilities and their costs are found in black
boxes at the bottom of the card.
When using an ability:
1. Check to ensure the card is ready
(see “ready” section to the right).
2. Spend water onto it equal
to the cost of the ability you are
using.
3. Resolve all text and effect icons in
the ability box.
• After using an ability on a card, the
card is not ready. If the ability’s cost
is 0, place a not ready disc on it .
• A card’s ability can affect cards in any column, not just its
own.
• When ability text uses the word “Enemy”, it refers to your
opponent’s people, not their camps

READY
IS MY CARD “READY”?
Camps: A faceup camp is always ready, unless you have
used one of its abilities this turn (a damaged camp can still
be ready).
People: A person is ready, unless any of these are true:
• It was played this turn.
• It was restored this turn.
• One of its abilities was used this turn.
• It is damaged .

Note: Cards with water discs on them are not ready unless
overridden by an ability, effect, or trait

GAME END

You win immediately when all your opponent’s camps
are destroyed.
If the deck runs out during the game, shuffle the discard pile
to form a new deck. If the deck runs out a second time, the
game ends in a draw.

CAMPS F.A.Q.

Adrenaline Lab: This includes damaged people who
entered play this turn, such as Wounded Soldier, and
people who are damaged and have used their ability.
You must pay the water cost of the person’s ability. If
Adrenaline Lab is using the ability of a person that says
“damage this card” for example, “this” refers to the
person being activated

Arcade: Punks are people too.
Blood Bank: You need a person to use this ability.
Cannon: If damage destroys your last camp, you lose
immediately before the Cannon ability completes.
Catapult: You need a person to use this ability.
Command Post: This can cost as little as 0 .
Construction Yard: This can be used on your people or
enemies, even if they are protected. It can place them in
any column that has space, and can push them in front or
behind a person already in that column.

Juggernaut: If Juggernaut has advanced once, you
can play a person in front of and/or behind it. A person
behind Juggernaut is protected and can’t be hit by damage
or injure, just the same as if they were behind a person. A
new person added to this column can push an existing
person to the other side of Juggernaut. When
Juggernaut is destroyed, place it facedown in your
camp row (moving any people in front).

Labor Camp: You need a person to use this ability.
Mercenary Camp: The opponent chooses. They can’t
choose to discard 2 cards unless they have 2 or more
cards in hand.
Mulcher: You need a person to use this ability.
Nest of Spies: This means any 2 people, including
punks.

Omen Clock: You may only advance an event if there is
an empty space in the event queue in front of the event.
You may advance opponent’s events. An opponent’s
event that is activated by Omen Clock is still their event.
Parachute Base: You must pay the water cost to play
the person, and the water cost of its ability.
Training Camp: The person goes into play in exactly
the same place. Cards with a “when this enters play”
[ trait ] (like Vanguard, Argo Yesky, Wounded
Soldier), perform that effect immediately. This person
does count for Nest of Spies or Transplant Lab.
Transplant Lab: This means any 2 people, including
punks.
Watchtower: Raiders, and 0 events both count.


GENERAL F.A.Q.

Damage/Injure/Destroy: On their own, these icons
can only hit unprotected cards. However,
cards that say any, all, or one of, ignore
protection, and follow their own rules.

Enemy: Your opponent’s people, not
their camps.
No Dumpster Diving: You may examine
cards your opponent discards during their
turn. You may not look through the discard
pile to determine if a card was played in a
previous turn.
No Friendly Fire: You cannot use
Injure/Damage /Destroy or other negative abilities/
effects on your own cards, unless they
specify that you must. You also cannot restore
your opponent’s cards.
No Hand Limit: There is no hand size limit.
No Peeking: Players cannot look at what
card is on the other side of punks.

PEOPLE F.A.Q.

New in v1.2: If you have no space in any of your
columns, you may play a person but you must first destroy
one of your existing people. This option to destroy applies
whenever playing a person, whether by performing the
Play Card action, resolving an event effect, card trait, junk
effect, or card ability.

Argo Yesky: If Argo is damaged but then restored, his trait
is in effect once again. Punks gain Argo’s ability. As punks
now have an ability, they should be marked as not ready
when entering play.

Cult Leader: The Cult Leader can destroy himself.

Doomsayer: If there is no room to move an event back,
it does not move. If you can’t move any of the opponent’s
events back, you may still play Doomsayer.

Karli Blaze: Karli’s [ trait ] takes effect when she enters
play or is restored. Karli’s ability is ready when she is played,
but not when she is restored. If combined with Training
Camp, people flipped this turn can use their abilities.

Mimic: You must pay the water cost of the chosen ability.
If Mimic is copying a card whose ability says “damage this
card” for example, “this” refers to the Mimic.

Molgur Stang: ”Any” means any of your opponent’s camps,
even if protected.

Punk: If an effect causes you to put a Punk from one of your
columns into your hand, it becomes a normal faceup card.

Rescue Team: Rescue Team can return itself. Returned
cards do not “remember” their previous situation if they
are returned to play. Any card returned (including Punks)
becomes a regular, faceup card in your hand.

Vanguard: The opponent’s damage happens
immediately (during your turn) and follows all normal rules.
If your damage destroys the opponent’s last camp, you
win before they get to do theirs.

Vera Vosh: If Vera’s [ trait ] becomes active after an ability
has already been used, it does not allow that ability to be
used again. Vera’s [ trait ] benefits herself, people, and
camps.

Zeto Khan: This has no effect on events already in your
queue. This does give Raiders 0.

EVENTS F.A.Q.

Bombardment: As usual, camps
already damaged will be destroyed.

High Ground: You can rearrange
people back into the same positions.

Radiation: “All people” is all people
currently in play, which includes your
own people.

Raiders: See “Raid”, pg 9. You can
resolve the raid icon ( ) more than
once per turn. Raiders will move up
on the event queue each turn, just
like any other event.

Truce: Returned cards do not
“remember” their previous situation
if they are returned to play. Any card
returned (including Punks) becomes
a regular, faceup card in your hand.

Uprising: If this causes you to have
more than six people, you may destroy
existing people to make room for punks.
