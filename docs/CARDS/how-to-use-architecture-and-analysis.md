I'll help you understand how to effectively use your ARCHITECTURE.md and CARD_ANALYSIS.md files alongside Claude (both here in the browser and Claude Code) to develop your Radlands online implementation smoothly.

## How These Files Will Help You

Your documentation files will serve as crucial reference points throughout development:

1. **ARCHITECTURE.md** provides the blueprint for your entire application:
   - Data models and type definitions
   - UI component hierarchy
   - Game flow logic
   - Core system architecture

2. **CARD_ANALYSIS.md** offers detailed implementation guidance for each card:
   - State tracking requirements
   - Interaction patterns
   - Edge cases to handle
   - Dependencies between cards/systems
   - Implementation priorities

## Development Process With Claude

Here's a recommended approach for leveraging these files with Claude:

### 1. Project Setup Phase

1. **Create repository skeleton** using Claude Code
   - Have Claude Code generate the initial project structure based on ARCHITECTURE.md
   - Set up React frontend, Node.js backend if using
   - Configure build system and basic routing

2. **Define core data models**
   - Share the relevant sections from ARCHITECTURE.md with Claude Code
   - Ask it to generate TypeScript interfaces for cards, game state, player state, etc.

### 2. Core Systems Implementation

1. **Implement basic game engine** first
   - Focus on the game loop, turn phases, and state management
   - Ask Claude to generate boilerplate code for game mechanics from ARCHITECTURE.md

2. **Develop the UI framework**
   - Have Claude Code generate component skeletons based on the UI hierarchy
   - Focus on layout and navigation before card-specific UI

### 3. Card Implementation

1. **Follow the priority order** from CARD_ANALYSIS.md
   - Start with basic mechanics, then conditional, then complex
   - Implement cards in batches with similar mechanics

2. **For each card category**:
   - Share the relevant card analyses with Claude Code
   - Ask for implementation of the specific game logic and UI components
   - Have Claude test the implementation with sample scenarios

### 4. Testing and Refinement

1. **Use edge cases from CARD_ANALYSIS.md** to test implementations
   - Ask Claude to generate test cases based on the edge cases
   - Test interactions between cards with known dependencies

2. **Iterative improvement**
   - When issues arise, refer back to both documents
   - Ask Claude to suggest solutions based on the architecture and analysis

## Best Practices For Working With Claude

1. **Share document sections selectively**
   - Don't overwhelm Claude with entire documents
   - Share only relevant sections when asking for specific implementations

2. **Be explicit about context**
   - Remind Claude which parts of ARCHITECTURE.md or CARD_ANALYSIS.md you're working from
   - Specify which files/components are currently being developed

3. **Iterative development**
   - Develop in small, testable increments
   - Validate basic mechanics before complex card interactions

4. **Use Claude for debugging**
   - When stuck, share the problematic code and relevant documentation sections
   - Ask for specific approaches to resolve issues

5. **Document as you go**
   - Have Claude help update documentation as implementation evolves
   - Keep track of any deviations from the original architecture

By systematically working through your architecture and card analysis with Claude's assistance, you'll maintain a structured approach to development while leveraging Claude's ability to help implement complex game mechanics.
